Minimal web client for Subsonic music streaming service - it actually works at this stage but not tested for public consumption.

Goals:
* Avoid complexity, this should remain very small and approachable
* Folder view reflecting actual file system is the primary view, since that's what's underserved by existing clients
* Easy to script by injecting Javascript, for ease in setting up hotkeys via AutoHotKey/osa
 
Questions:
* How will search work?
* Continue on-demand loading of folders/metadata from server, or slurp it all on startup?
* What's a good way to deal with the awkwardness of storing passwords...
*
